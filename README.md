# LOLCard
The purpose of this project is to create business cards based on information from League of Legends(LOL) users.  
League of Legends users' levels, tiers, winning rates, summoner icons, and Most Champion information are used in business cards.  
If you want to show off your LOL career, try this project!


# This Project
* The LOL information used in this project comes from `OP.GG`, the League of Legends stats search engine. 
* Users of this program can get their own business cards by simply performing simple tasks such as entering the summoner's name and selecting the line they usually go to. 
* The business card is provided as an image file (of course, you can save it in your own gallery)
